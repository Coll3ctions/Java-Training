#Scope of a varible

*Scope* of a varible limited within the block it is declared.

It is visible only within the block.
Accesing this varible from outside of the block(outside the curly bracce) gives error

##Type conversion / type casting

Java will automatically cast any type if the code satisfies two conditions:

1. The two data type must be compitable (like string and float are not compitable, but float and int are)
2. The destination side must be greater than the source side.
